//! `pg_catalog`, as relations **computed** from what this node has rather than stored.
//!
//! `docs/plans/phase-9-rails.md` §Unit 5 decided the shape and this is it: a catalog relation is a
//! view over the records, materialised per query, with no duplicated state and no way to drift.
//! The alternative — catalog tables as real tables in a reserved key space — would give every
//! `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE` and sequence allocation a second write to keep in
//! step, forever, and a `pg_class` that disagreed with the `'m'` space would be wrong in a way
//! only a client notices.
//!
//! # What is in it, and why it is short
//!
//! **`pg_type` lists the types this server has.** Six, with PostgreSQL's own OIDs for them,
//! because those are the OIDs a `RowDescription` from this node carries. The alternative was to
//! list PostgreSQL's standard set — `int4` is 23, `numeric` is 1700 — and that would tell a client
//! this server has types it answers `0A000` for.
//!
//! The predecessor left the choice open and asked for a capture rather than an argument, and the
//! capture is of `ActiveRecord` rather than of PostgreSQL: `add_pg_decoders` builds its decoders
//! with `filter_map`, so a name it gets no row for is a decoder it does not make;
//! `TypeMapInitializer#run` partitions the rows it is handed and registers each partition, so an
//! empty partition registers nothing; and a column whose OID is in no map decodes as a string.
//! **A short `pg_type` costs a client nothing it can see, and this node never sends an OID that is
//! not in it.** `tests/corpus/pg19_pg_catalog.txt` carries the argument beside the rows.
//!
//! **`pg_range` is empty**, because this node has no range types, and it has no `oid` column —
//! which is not an omission but the capture: `SELECT oid FROM pg_range` is `42703` on a real
//! server, and that is what makes `ActiveRecord`'s `LEFT JOIN pg_range AS r ON oid = rngtypid`
//! legal with an unqualified `oid`. A `pg_range` given an `oid` would make that statement `42702`.
//!
//! # Read-only, and the refusal is `42501`
//!
//! Measured rather than assumed: `DROP TABLE pg_type`, `ALTER TABLE pg_type ADD COLUMN` and
//! `CREATE INDEX … ON pg_type` all answer `42501 permission denied: "pg_type" is a system
//! catalog`. So does every write here — including the DML a *superuser* is allowed to attempt on a
//! real server, which is the divergence `tests/pg_catalog.rs` declares: there are no roles here,
//! and a computed relation has nothing to write to.
